## New & Returning Products

Here are our brand-new additions for 2025, plus details on returning favorites. Everything else remains from previous years’ lineups!

### 1. Free Coffee Jam Cold Brew

I couldn't find good cold brew in the US, so here it is. If you took the best coffee beans, and cold - brewed them, this is what you'd find. Instead the options in the US market are mostly over-roasted and bitter. This is a true wine-lover's coffee. I made this with my friend in Paris (Valentin/Quasi).

Get a free 1pk on orders over $100 to try it out. Add it to your cart, you'll see it automatically applied. Come back and post on WB and let everyone k now what you think.

### 2. The Hudson Whisky Glass

A stemless handblown whisky glass designed by @kevanmah who won the BD auction last year. A sleek, modern whisky tumbler designed to highlight the aromatics of bourbon, scotch, or any of your favorite dark spirits. Named after his sons. Ships mid Feb.

### 3. The Arthur Whisky Glass

A stemmed handblown whisky glass designed by @kevanmah who won the BD auction last year. All the elegance of our standard Whisky glass but with a graceful stem. Ideal for those who love a more elevated sipping experience—keeps hands away from the bowl to maintain the perfect serving temperature. Named after his sons. Ships mid Feb.

### 4. GLVSAIN + Kato Glasses

We accidentally misprinted the Glasvin logo for Kato. Now we are selling them with a benefit of 10% going to charity per Kato's choosing. Own a piece of Glasvin history! We are also bringing back the $25/glass we started with on the first WB day (despite all the inflation since then) when you are in the top tier of spend.

### 5. GV Martini Glass

Part of our durable GV Home line, this handblown martini glass strikes a balance between classic cocktail geometry and sturdy construction. Perfect for shaken or stirred cocktails. Designed with Overstory NYC.

### 6. GV Beer Glass

A taller, tapered shape engineered to preserve the head and deliver your beer’s aromas. Imagine drinking a nice craft pilsner out of this. But really can drink anything out of it

### 7. GV Small Coupe

A petite coupe - a cross between our normal coupe and Nick and Nora. My personal two cents is that the Coupe was on the larger side for a lot of stuff so I was delighted that Overstory wanted to make a smaller one. Designed with Overstory in NYC.

### 8. Returning Favorites: The Fu & The Kane

**We’re also excited that Fu and Kane are back** by popular demand!

**The Fu** was created in collaboration with @CFu . Its broad bowl and elegant silhouette make it ideal for swirling heavier reds and capturing delicate aromatics. **7% of all Fu glass sales are donated to charity of @CFu 's choosing.**

![](https://glas.vin/cdn/shop/files/GlassonBlack_3.jpg?v=1705649706&width=300)


**The Kane** was designed by @K_John_Joseph . This shape has a slightly narrower bowl than Fu, making it perfect for both reds and whites, with a graceful, taller chimney to focus aromas.
